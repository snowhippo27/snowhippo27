All packs created by me are available for public use.
If you use any of my textures, I only ask 2 things;
1. You at least make some changes, not just redistribute my original pack.
2. You leave a link back to the original GitHub project that you used from.
If you don't do both of those things, I contact you, and if you refuse to change it, I will take down and/or claim the post/download/project.
